This is a collection of tools for mysql db administration.

Recommended usage:

	Drop the db.tools directory somewhere.  Then either put this
	directory in your PATH or symlink each script into directory that
	is in your path.  I personally use the later approach.


Tools:

	db -	a command-line tool to make working with one or more mysql instances easier.

		It supports tab completion.

		examples:

			db foo ls	# lists the schemata in the "foo" mysql instance
			db tag		# lists the mysql instances it finds on the current host
			db <tab>	# lists the mysql instances it finds on the current host
			db foo cli b<tab>	# lists the schemata in foo that start with a "b"
			db foo cli bar	# starts a mysql command-line instance in the schema bar
			db foo ls bar acct	# show table defn of bar.acct

			db auth-set root	# setup credentials for accessing the db
			eval "$( db auth-set root )"	# do it for real

		setup tool:

			cd /baz/bin
			git clone ...
			ln -s db.tools/db .
			cd db.tools/db.conf
			cp -a default this
			cp -p pool/local.params this/
			cat this/setup	# edit to your taste
			cat this/local.params	# edit to your taste
			. /baz/db.tools/db.conf/pool/completion_dbtool	# add to your bashrc

		setup mysql instance for use with tool:

			For the typical single-instance install, copy the
			db.tools/example/dbtool_conf file into your mysql
			data directory.  Edit this/local.params to make the
			tool find your mysql data directory.

		security:

			Although this tool tries not to expose your
			credentials, it is best not to use this tool in
			other than a trusted environment.

			It is assumed that the unix user you run as can
			read the mysql data dir and the dbtool_conf file.
			It need not be able to read the schema directories.
			To make this secure, use unix groups and/or make
			your machine difficult to compromise.

		customization:

			The tool is decomposed into modules on purpose.  The
			authentication system is especially customizable.

			If you come up with a better auth system, please share...

		More/better documentation welcome.
